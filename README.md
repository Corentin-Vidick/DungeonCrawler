# Coco's Dungeon Crawler

    This is a dungeon crawler style text based game developped in Python. The aim of the game is for the player to navigate through the dungeon to find the exit. Along the way they might find enemy skeletons which they will have to fight or evade.


## Features

    This game is a text based adventure. The player is asked to make a choice, wether which direction to go, if they want to rest (possibility to gain health) or if they want to fight a skeleton or try to evade it. The game then calculates and informs the player on the results of their decision

### How the game works

- __I - Starting page__

    The starting page offers the player a menu style choice, letting them choose between starting the game, reading the rules and the credits.

  - __Rules__
    
    Here the rules of the game are explained to the player. The end game - finding the exit - is explained as well as the steps to achieve this and the challenges that can be found along the way.

  - __Credits__

    Informs the player about who developped the game.

- __II - Decision time__

    At the start of the game, the player is presented with three choices:
     - Rest - one in ten chance of gaining 1 health, otherwise nothing happens
     - Look at map - the player can look at the map. They will see their current position as well as all the rooms previously visited. If a room contained a skeleton and the player fled, the skeleton will be visible on the map
     - Move - guides the player through the movement phase

- __III - Movement time__

    The player is presented with two to four directions they can go. Possible directions are calculated by the program and only valid options can be selected.

- __IV - Movement result__

    There are three possible outcomes to any move the player makes:
     - The room is empty - player is presented with new decision time
     - The room contains a skeleton - player is presented with a fight or flight option
     - The room contains the exit - player wins

- __V - Skeleton encounter__

    The player is given a choice to fight or flee. Results are as follows:
     - If the player decides to flee, they have a 50% chance of success, in which case they will move in a random possible direction, and be sent back to decision time. If the escape fails, they are forced to fight the skeleton
     - If the player decides to fight, the program assigns random hits until either the player or the skeleton runs out of health. Hits are programmed as follows:
        - 10% - both the player and skeleton hit
        - 10% - player deals a critical hit (2x damage)
        - 20% - the skeleton hits the player
        - 60% - the player hits the skeleton

- __VI - End of game__

    The game ends in one of two ways:
     - The player is defeated by a skeleton, they die.
     - The player finds the exit, they win.
    The player can then decide to play again or exit the program



### Existing Features

- __Map__

    The map is created by generating 25 rooms. Each room is an object with:
     - a position: allows to select particular rooms
     - a status: dark (room hasn't been visited), empty (room visited), player, skeleton or door (exit)
     - contents: currently not used but will be able to hold items such as a sword, shield or key
    Only visited rooms are visible to the player when they open the map in-game. Walls are present to indicate the size of the map and show limits.

- __Entities__

    Entities are created as objects. This allows to give them a position, health level and attack strength.

- __Movement__

    The position of the player is checked at each turn, dependant on the room's position, it is determined which directions the player can move. Only possible directions are offered to the player and can be selected.

- __Fight or flight__

    Player is presented with the choice to flee or fight when they enter a room containing a skeleton. Success chances of an escape are 50%.

- __Fight__

    Results of a fight are randomly generated by assigning a random value and comparing it to our possible outcomes. Choice of percentages has been made to keep fights interesting with different possible outcomes.

- __Flight__

    When the escape is successful, player is moved in a random direction ot keep spirit of flight.

- __Error handling__

    When an input is asked for, the request will be repeated until a correct option is given. This is achieved through a "while True" loop.
